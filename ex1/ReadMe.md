### Project description:  ####

We created five classes that represent the weighted and undirectional graph.
this project has a three main function:
IsConnected = check if the graph's vertices are connected all each other.
shortestPathDist= return us the shortest distance path between two nodes.In this function we use Dijkstra algorithm
shortestPath= return us a list of the shortest path between two nodes.
save and load = this functions supposed to load/save the graph to a file.
